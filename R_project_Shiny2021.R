                                       of data before running a regression. For this report, we create a visual representation
                                       of correlation using corrplot package in R. Some interesting findings are following. 
                                       IQ score correlated with wage suggests that intelligence has a positive implication 
                                       on the earnings. Education has positive linear relationship with wage indicating that 
                                       as years of education increasing, we expect that monthly wage increases as well. 
                                       Talent support is positively correlated with education. Education of father has 
                                       moderate positive linear relationship with wage variable of an individual. 
                                       Curious thing: it is higher correlated than education of mother. 
                                       There may be different explanations. For example, having a gender 
                                       wage discrimination, we may assume that fatherâ€™s years of education 
                                       as well as his gender possibly can have higher salary, meaning that
                                       household where a man brings a significant income can provide more 
                                       schooling years to children. Another curios thing: negative correlation
                                       of experience with education. One of the possible explanations is that more 
                                       years of education an individual has less years she works and vice versa.", style = "text-align: justify"))),

                                       decreases our monthly wage by 17%. We can assume that the reason for that can be a lack of education.
                                       We can draaw a graph to see how number years of education by men differs from number of education 
                                       years by woman. On this graph we can observe  that there is no significant difference. There are a
